# Question.
Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.


Write an SQL query to report the first login date for each player.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.


# Answer.
select player_id, min(event_date) as 'first_login' # 가장 과거의 방문 일자를 알아야 하므로 min() 함수 활용
from Activity
group by player_id # player_id 로 그룹화하여 각 사용자의 방문 일자 확인
order by event_date asc
